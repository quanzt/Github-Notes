//Exclude files from git without committing changes to .gitignore
"My co-worker pointed me to the .git/info/exclude file which, much like a .gitignore file, allows you to ignore files from being staged. This keeps things nice and clean, and the best part is that you don’t commit anything in the .git/ directory, so it’s like your own personal .gitignore that no one else can see or touch!"

//to push your local serverfix branch to the awesomebranch branch on the remote project
git push origin serverfix:awesomebranch 

//create local branch from a remote-tracking branch
git checkout -b <branch> <remote>/<branch>. 
This is a common enough operation that Git provides the --track shorthand:
$ git checkout --track origin/serverfix

//If you already have a local branch and want to set it to a remote branch you just pulled down, or want to change the upstream branch //you’re tracking, you can use the -u or --set-upstream-to option to git branch to explicitly set it at any time.
$ git branch -u origin/serverfix
Branch serverfix set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin.

//*Note
Upstream shorthand
When you have a tracking branch set up, you can reference its upstream branch with the @{upstream} or @{u} shorthand. So if you’re on the master branch and it’s tracking origin/master, you can say something like git merge @{u} instead of git merge origin/master if you wish.

git push --set-upstream origin BRANCHNAME
