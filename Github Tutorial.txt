//Exclude files from git without committing changes to .gitignore
"My co-worker pointed me to the .git/info/exclude file which, much like a .gitignore file, allows you to ignore files from being staged. This keeps things nice and clean, and the best part is that you don’t commit anything in the .git/ directory, so it’s like your own personal .gitignore that no one else can see or touch!"
